# TEEHR Workshop at the May 2023 CIROH Developers Conference
This repo contains the workshop materials that will be used for the TEEHR Workshop at the May 2023 CIROH Developers Conference.
It is assumed that the workshop participants will be working on the CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub account where the cached data is stored.
If you are working though these workshop materials on your own computer, you will need to download the cached data from our S3 bucket and change the `CACH_DIR` variable in each notebook to run the examples.
